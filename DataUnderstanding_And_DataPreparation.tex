\subsubsection{Data Insights}

The Pricing data is good to see the volatility trend of cryptocurrency.
Volume and Marketcapitalization data helps in creating models for
predicting future prices.

\subsection{Data Quality}

All data is in .csv format and has consistent delimiters.

Since the data in different attributes are of different units. It
needs normalization.

As such data is clean and consistent, we do fine some percentage of
missing values. 

bitcoin\_price has some initial 2 months data for Volume missing

bitcoin\_dataset has around 0.23\% missing values overall. Since this
is a very small percentage, we consider these as ignorable. 

We didnt' find any data errors or coding inconsistencies as such.

No spelling inconsistencies

No coding inconsistencies or bad metadata is found.
